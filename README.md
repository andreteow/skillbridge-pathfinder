### 🔍 **2. Career Matching & Skill Gap Analysis**  
- User selects a **target career path** (e.g., "I want to move from Marketing to Data Analytics").  
- AI compares the user’s skills to **industry benchmarks** (e.g., job descriptions, real-world requirements).  
- Output:  
  - **“You are 70% ready for Data Analytics”**  
  - Missing skills highlighted (e.g., "You need SQL, Python, and Data Visualization").  

### 🚀 **3. Personalized Training Pathway**
